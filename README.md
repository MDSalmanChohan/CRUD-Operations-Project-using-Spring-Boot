# CRUD-Operations-Project-using-Spring-Boot
Project Description
Project Title: CRUD Operations Project using Spring Boot
Overview:
The CRUD Operations Project is a comprehensive example of using Spring Boot to create a RESTful web service that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. This project serves as a foundational template for building robust and scalable backend services using Spring Boot.

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: Framework to simplify the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications.
Spring Data JPA: Abstraction over JPA to simplify database operations.
H2 Database: In-memory database for testing and development purposes.
Maven: Build and dependency management.
Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code for model classes.
JUnit & Mockito: For unit and integration testing.
Swagger: For API documentation and testing.
Features:

Create Operation: Add new records to the database.
Read Operation: Retrieve records from the database.
Update Operation: Modify existing records in the database.
Delete Operation: Remove records from the database.
Validation: Input validation using Hibernate Validator.
Exception Handling: Global exception handling to manage and respond to errors effectively.
API Documentation: Integrated Swagger UI for easy API testing and documentation.
Learning Outcomes:

Understanding of RESTful web services and their implementation in Spring Boot.
Practical knowledge of Spring Data JPA for database operations.
Techniques for effective input validation and error handling.
Exposure to automated testing with JUnit and Mockito.
Utilization of Swagger for API documentation.
